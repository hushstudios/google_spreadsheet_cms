### Running the Script

####Dependencies:

- oauth2client (`pip install oauth2client`)


#### Setup Google API Credentials 

1. Eanble Goolge SpreadSheet API and Google Drive API
2. Make sure the credentials are for a service account. 
3. Your credentials should be saved as `keyfil.json`. The file should look like this

{
   "type":"",
   "project_id":"",
   "private_key_id":"",
   "private_key":"",
   "client_email":"",
   "client_id":"",
   "auth_uri":"",
   "token_uri":"",
   "client_x509_cert_url":""
}
```
